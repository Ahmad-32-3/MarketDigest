But Berkshire's stakes in public companies may no longer be the driving force behind its success.\n\nOn May 3 Berkshire published its first-quarter results, which included a new record position in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in U.S. Treasury bills of $342.39 billion. As of May 2, the value of Berkshire's public equity portfolio was $277.41 billion, or roughly a quarter its market cap of $1.16 trillion. The rest of Berkshire's value comes from its subsidiaries.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nBerkshire has plenty of valuable wholly-owned businesses, from the BNSF railroad to utility giant Berkshire Hathaway Energy. But by far the most important category is its property and casualty (P&C) insurance businesses. At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, investors had plenty of questions about the future of the P&C businesses: from how they will fare in the face of an onslaught of private equity investment to the changing landscape of insurance in the autonomous age.\n\nAre potential changes in P&C insurance enough to derail the Berkshire Hathaway investment thesis? Here are key takeaways from what Warren Buffett and Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations, Ajit Jain, said during the annual meeting.\n\nIn Q1, income from insurance underwriting and insurance investment combined was $4.23 billion, or a whopping 43.9% of total operating earnings.\n\nAs insurance has grown, it has become a bigger topic at Berkshire's annual meetings. And for good reason, considering its impact on operating earnings.\n\nBerkshire has maintained its focus on the P&C side of the insurance industry -- distancing itself from the life insurance business, now dominated by private equity. During the annual meeting, Buffett and Jain said that private equity firms can make a lot of money in that area, but that the leverage and credit risk aren't appealing to Berkshire anymore from a risk-management standpoint.\n\nAnother change to the insurance business has been the rise of autonomous vehicles. An audience member asked if this rise would change the underwriting requirements of the insurance business. Buffett responded, \"We expect change in all of our ideas,\" welcoming changes in the auto insurance industry. He also said that an annual auto insurance policy from GEICO in the 1950s could cost as little as $40, whereas today, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary to have a $2,000 annual policy. Even as the cost of insurance is up some 50-fold, Buffett said that accidents have fallen by more than 80%. So the prospect of autonomous vehicles reducing accidents further doesn't necessarily jeopardize the insurance investment opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen CEO Warren Buffett steps aside, change will come. Heir apparent Greg Abel is skilled, but a different kind of manager.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha discussed the trade war at Berkshire Hathaway's annual conference.\n\nThe famed investor largely shied away from tech until his 2016 Apple bet. It turned out to be his greatest investment.\n\nThe legendary investor first appeared in a 1965 item on the ouster of the president of a textile company called Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWe recently published a list of Did Jim Cramer Hit or Miss On These 13 Stock Predictions?

Major indices rallied to record highs as artificial intelligence emerged as a key investment theme, especially in the technology sector. Stocks also rallied amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on inflationary pressures subsiding significantly. The rally to record highs saw valuations get out of hand beyond historical norms.\n\nA change of administration and policies in the US was always going to be the catalyst to sway investors to exit risky bets amid the premium valuations. Donald Trump’s taking over, waging a trade war against allies, and imposing stringent tariffs on imports into the US is the latest headwind that is sending US equity markets lower.\n\nThe S&P 500 is already down by about 6%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ is down by about 8%. The pullbacks come on growing concerns that the tariff war fuelled by Trump could plunge the global economy into recession. Similarly, there are growing fears that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from cutting interest rates as inflationary pressures show signs of edging higher.\n\nConsequently, the US equity market remains on edge, with stocks exposed to the tariff war pulling back by double-digit percentage points. The uncertainty around President Trump’s tariffs and policies is sure to heighten volatility in the markets, as was the case in his first term.\n\nTrump’s announcement of tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019 caused stocks to perform poorly, according to data from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fast forward, we are seeing a repeat of similar performance in 2025, but on a larger scale.\n\nNevertheless, a falling stock market will always present unique investment opportunities for investors with a high-risk tolerance. As prices come down, opportunities to invest in stocks trading at highly discounted valuations are increasingly cropping up.\n\n″‘Buying the dip’ depends upon your timeframe,” says Richard Smith, CEO of investing tool RiskSmith. “If you can keep your money in the markets for at least a couple of years, this is a good dip to buy.

While Robert Atchinson, his longtime collaborator and fellow Co-founder, serves as the firm’s Portfolio Manager, Gross’s leadership and strategic vision have played a foundational role in shaping Adage’s long-term investment philosophy and reputation. The two met in the mid-1980s while working as Harvard University’s endowment analysts. Their professional synergy led them to leave Harvard Management Company in the 1990s, following public scrutiny over performance-based bonuses.

This is a testament to the disciplined, research-driven investment framework that Gross helped instill.\n\nGross himself brings a deep background in healthcare investing, having served for nearly two decades at Harvard Management Company in various roles, including Healthcare and Retail Analyst, Equity Research Director, and Partner.

He remains actively engaged with his alma mater, serving on the advisory boards of the Steve Hawk Center for Applied Securities Analysis and the Nicholas Center for Applied Corporate Finance.

There is often discussion in online communities like Reddit about whether to buy the dip.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Electronic Components Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nHowever, financial advisors urge clients to stick with long-term investment plans during market volatility. While buying cheap can be a good idea, experts warn that it is nearly impossible to try and time the market and wait for the perfect moment to buy at the lowest price.\n\nEric Roberge, certified financial planner and CEO of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston, says that it is impossible to time the market without simply getting lucky. Instead, he suggests sticking to a thoughtful, rules-based investment strategy that focuses not on short-term market swings but on your long-term goals.\n\nJay Spector, certified financial planner and co-chief executive officer of EverVest Financial in Scottsdale, Arizona, explains that when buying assets during a market downturn, it is important to have a disciplined approach. Some people may be tempted to wait in cash while looking to buy at rock-bottom prices. However, no one can predict where that bottom is.\n\nWaiting on the sidelines could mean missing out and might not be the right strategy. Research has shown that some of the best returns can follow the biggest dips. Spector says that instead of hoping to buy at the absolute bottom, investors should consider “dollar-cost averaging,” which means investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals.\n\nMost importantly, experts say that investors should know why they want to invest in the first place. Sticking to your long-term goals can be key to successful investing during times of uncertainty and market panic.\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years, we looked for stocks with strong growth potential. We used search terms like “best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years” and reviewed financial media reports and various online resources to compile a list of more than 30 stocks that investors can consider buying and holding for the next decade.

While buying cheap can be a good idea, experts warn that it is nearly impossible to try and time the market and wait for the perfect moment to buy at the lowest price.\n\nEric Roberge, certified financial planner and CEO of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston, says that it is impossible to time the market without simply getting lucky. Instead, he suggests sticking to a thoughtful, rules-based investment strategy that focuses not on short-term market swings but on your long-term goals.\n\nJay Spector, certified financial planner and co-chief executive officer of EverVest Financial in Scottsdale, Arizona, explains that when buying assets during a market downturn, it is important to have a disciplined approach. Some people may be tempted to wait in cash while looking to buy at rock-bottom prices. However, no one can predict where that bottom is.\n\nWaiting on the sidelines could mean missing out and might not be the right strategy. Research has shown that some of the best returns can follow the biggest dips. Spector says that instead of hoping to buy at the absolute bottom, investors should consider “dollar-cost averaging,” which means investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals.\n\nMost importantly, experts say that investors should know why they want to invest in the first place. Sticking to your long-term goals can be key to successful investing during times of uncertainty and market panic.\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years, we looked for stocks with strong growth potential.

Chase Coleman is one hedge fund manager who benefited from the impressive run by investing his hedge fund’s money in some of the top-performing AI stocks.\n\nFounded by Coleman in 2001, Tiger Global Management LLC was one of the best-performing hedge funds after gaining 24% in 2024. The impressive return came on the billionaire investor betting on some of the biggest companies with significant exposure to artificial intelligence.\n\nFast forward, Coleman is one of the most significant casualties of the broader stock market correction. With the S&P 500 pulling back by about 6% and tech-heavy Nasdaq down by about 8%, the billionaire investor has felt the full brunt of the artificial intelligence-driven run cooling off. A good number of Tiger Global Management stock holdings have shed more than 10% in market value as the overall stock market correction gathers steam.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Seth Klarman’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s 10 Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential.\n\nWhile up to 20% pullbacks might rattle most investors, billionaire Investor Coleman’s strategy focuses on long-term investing. Consequently, he is never perturbed by short-term market corrections. Coleman continues to maintain significant holdings in tech giants on expectations the segment will continue growing amid the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n“Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies, and how well they use it,” he said, giving the example of Amazon using ChatGPT to facilitate shopping. “It’s going to be gradual. Be patient.”\n\nWe combed Tiger Group Management LLC SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Chase Coleman’s 10 Stocks with Huge Upside Potential. We focused on stocks that have pulled back significantly and therefore command significant upside potential. We then analyzed the stocks on why they stand out, as solid value investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what could happen next to Amazon shares.\n\nKroger, Amazon, and Walmart are all evergreen retail investments.\n\nQuantum computing represents the next technological frontier, potentially revolutionizing fields from drug discovery to cybersecurity. The global quantum computing market is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. In 1981, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman first proposed the concept of quantum computers, recognizing that classical machines could never efficiently simulate quantum systems.\n\nWe recently published a list of Billionaire Chase Coleman’s 10 Stocks with Huge Upside Potential.

There is often discussion in online communities like Reddit about whether to buy the dip.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Electronic Components Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nHowever, financial advisors urge clients to stick with long-term investment plans during market volatility. While buying cheap can be a good idea, experts warn that it is nearly impossible to try and time the market and wait for the perfect moment to buy at the lowest price.\n\nEric Roberge, certified financial planner and CEO of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston, says that it is impossible to time the market without simply getting lucky. Instead, he suggests sticking to a thoughtful, rules-based investment strategy that focuses not on short-term market swings but on your long-term goals.\n\nJay Spector, certified financial planner and co-chief executive officer of EverVest Financial in Scottsdale, Arizona, explains that when buying assets during a market downturn, it is important to have a disciplined approach. Some people may be tempted to wait in cash while looking to buy at rock-bottom prices. However, no one can predict where that bottom is.\n\nWaiting on the sidelines could mean missing out and might not be the right strategy. Research has shown that some of the best returns can follow the biggest dips. Spector says that instead of hoping to buy at the absolute bottom, investors should consider “dollar-cost averaging,” which means investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals.\n\nMost importantly, experts say that investors should know why they want to invest in the first place. Sticking to your long-term goals can be key to successful investing during times of uncertainty and market panic.\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years, we looked for stocks with strong growth potential.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other Billionaire Chase Coleman’s stocks with huge upside potential.\n\nEquity markets achieved an unprecedented winning streak over the past two years at the back of an artificial intelligence-driven run. Major US indices were on a roll, soaring to record highs as investors tailored their investments to opportunities around the revolutionary technology. Chase Coleman is one hedge fund manager who benefited from the impressive run by investing his hedge fund’s money in some of the top-performing AI stocks.\n\nFounded by Coleman in 2001, Tiger Global Management LLC was one of the best-performing hedge funds after gaining 24% in 2024. The impressive return came on the billionaire investor betting on some of the biggest companies with significant exposure to artificial intelligence.\n\nFast forward, Coleman is one of the most significant casualties of the broader stock market correction. With the S&P 500 pulling back by about 6% and tech-heavy Nasdaq down by about 8%, the billionaire investor has felt the full brunt of the artificial intelligence-driven run cooling off. A good number of Tiger Global Management stock holdings have shed more than 10% in market value as the overall stock market correction gathers steam.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Seth Klarman’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s 10 Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential.\n\nWhile up to 20% pullbacks might rattle most investors, billionaire Investor Coleman’s strategy focuses on long-term investing. Consequently, he is never perturbed by short-term market corrections. Coleman continues to maintain significant holdings in tech giants on expectations the segment will continue growing amid the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n“Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies, and how well they use it,” he said, giving the example of Amazon using ChatGPT to facilitate shopping. “It’s going to be gradual. Be patient.”\n\nWe combed Tiger Group Management LLC SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Chase Coleman’s 10 Stocks with Huge Upside Potential. We focused on stocks that have pulled back significantly and therefore command significant upside potential. We then analyzed the stocks on why they stand out, as solid value investments.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (NASDAQ:CORT) stands against Billionaire Jim Simons’ RenTech’s other small-cap stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nJim Simons was (and still is even after his death in May 2024) one of the biggest names – if not the biggest – in the hedge fund space. He was a gifted mathematician and had a successful career in academia before making a bold pivot to finance in the late 70s.\n\nIn 1978, he founded Monemetrics (a currency trading firm) and Limroy (a hedge fund), which were collapsed into one entity in 1982 and renamed Renaissance Technologies Corporation. This entity had one major objective: to use quantitative, computer-driven models to exploit market inefficiencies. In other words, Simons and his team were committed to making investment decisions based on sophisticated algorithms.\n\nRenaissance Technologies (RenTech) began as a hedge fund but later morphed into something bigger. It is now an investment management firm that operates several hedge funds. Its flagship offering is the Medallion Fund. The Medallion Fund is known for extraordinary returns. During the dot.com crash (early 2000s) and the financial crisis (2007-2011), Medallion’s returns were 56.6% and 74.6%, respectively. Following the first two years of operation, the lowest annual return was 31.5%.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Seth Klarman’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s 10 Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential.\n\nThe Medallion Fund’s track record in the market, and by extension RenTech’s, made Simons a lot of money. At death, he was worth $31.4 billion and ranked among the top 100 richest people in the world. And, as Simons often said, all of the success he had in the market comes down to the love of mathematics. Accordingly, the Medallion Fund has been capable of extraordinary returns mostly because the investment team – led by Simons – leveraged mathematics.\n\nThe fund utilizes algorithm-based methods to identify patterns and leverage past data for investing decisions. That is why RenTech invested (and continues to invest) billions in intellectuals and professionals from fields like Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics. In one of his last interviews, he said: “We hired statisticians, physicists, astronomers, mathematicians — the important thing was that they were very smart.”\n\nJim Simons was a generational talent when it came to investing. He started an investment business and led to heights that others can only dream of. And because his legacy lives in RenTech, it makes sense to want to know what companies they’re invested in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Falling Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.
